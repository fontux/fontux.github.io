* begin src in lists should work

  - Foo
    #+begin_src ruby
    class Hello
      def say
        puts 'cheers'
      end
    end
    #+end_src

  - Bar

    #+begin_src ruby
    puts "This should not get lumped into the above line Example"
    #+end_src
    
    A paragraph should go here.

    + A sublist goes here with another example
      #+begin_src sh
      echo "Hello"
      #+end_src
      
      And this is a paragraph
  - Hello
